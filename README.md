# Emotional-Well-Being-Game
This is the emotional well being game I developed for my school. The same one I referred to on my google form.


The folder is called Creative L & L, Creative is the name of my school and L & L stands for 'Life and Living', the subject in which we are taught emotional intelligence and other holisitic matters. Instead of naming our classes 1st Standard, 2nd Standard, we use the name of flowers. Jasmine is the youngest age group and this section of the game has been developed for them, hence the name Jasmine. Aster is the next age group where we have 3 cards on screen with 12 emotions to choose from. That has not been developed yet due to external limitations so please don't click on that yet.

The AgeSelectionScreen is the main menu to this game. Over here, you can select your Age from the ranges given. 
Once that's selected, you'll be taken to the instructions screen where you'll be told how to play the game. You'll start playing the game after you click the start arrow.
The game works as follows -> When the game starts a voice will call out the text on screen,eg: 'angry'. The two face down cards, will turn face up revealing two images of different emotions. One of them matches the text on screen while the other doesn't. If you click on the correct emotion, an animation plays and the progress bar updates. If you click on the wrong one, an animation plays letting you know you were wrong and showing you the correct emotion, updating the progress bar. Once 10 rounds are done you'll be taken to the score screen where your progress will be displayed . You can then choose to play again or return to the main menu - the age selection screen.

Enjoy, hope you take away a thing or two ;)
